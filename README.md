# [Version 2 of The AWS SDK for iOS Developer Preview](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ios-v2)
We are happy to announce that based on your feedback, we have made significant improvements to our [ AWS SDK for iOS](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ios-v2). We rebuilt the AWS SDK for iOS from the ground up to conform to Objective-C conventions and take advantage of new features in the Cocoa framework. The new SDK improves interoperability with a number of other frameworks and projects in the iOS developer ecosystem. The SDK supports all of the existing functionality, and it also includes several new features.

The new SDK is available in our [aws-sdk-ios-v2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ios-v2) repository.
